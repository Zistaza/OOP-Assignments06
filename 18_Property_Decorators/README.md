# Property Decorators in Python (@property, @setter, @deleter)

Property decorators in Python provide a way to control access to instance variables. With `@property`, `@<property>.setter`, and `@<property>.deleter`, you can define custom behavior when getting, setting, or deleting an attribute, while making it appear as though youâ€™re interacting with regular attributes.

## âœ… Explanation

In this example, we create a `Product` class with a private attribute `_price`. We use property decorators to manage access to this attribute.

### Key Details:

1. **@property**:

   * Allows you to access `_price` like a normal attribute (`item.price`), rather than calling a method (`item.get_price()`).
   * This enhances readability and maintains a clean interface.

2. **@price.setter**:

   * This decorator allows you to control the modification of `_price` by adding validation logic (e.g., ensuring that the price is positive).
   * It ensures that the data is only modified in an acceptable way.

3. **@price.deleter**:

   * Provides a way to delete the `_price` attribute.
   * When the attribute is deleted, you can also display a custom message or perform additional cleanup.

## ðŸ“Œ Why Use Property Decorators?

* **Data Protection**: Protects sensitive data inside a class by controlling how attributes are accessed or modified.
* **Controlled Access**: Ensures that reading, writing, and deletion of an attribute follows certain rules or logic.
* **Cleaner Code**: Provides a Pythonic approach, making the code cleaner and more intuitive by allowing attribute-like access, while still having the benefits of method functionality.

By using property decorators, you can enhance the flexibility and security of your classes while keeping them easy to use and maintain.
