# **Build, Compose, and Decorate: A Complete Traditional OOP**

This project covers core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Python-specific techniques to create flexible, maintainable, and scalable applications. It demonstrates the power of composition, inheritance, and decorators in Python.

## **Key Features:**

* **Super() and Inheritance**: Leveraging inheritance and the `super()` function for cleaner, reusable code.
* **Abstract Classes**: Enforcing consistent behavior across subclasses with abstract base classes.
* **Instance, Class, and Static Methods**: Using different types of methods to interact with object and class-level data.
* **Composition and Aggregation**: Building flexible systems using composition and aggregation for a "has-a" relationship between objects.
* **MRO & Diamond Inheritance**: Resolving complex inheritance structures with Method Resolution Order (MRO) to avoid conflicts.
* **Decorators**: Modifying or enhancing functions and classes without changing their core logic using decorators.
* **Property Decorators**: Providing controlled access to object attributes with getter, setter, and deleter methods.
* **Callable Objects**: Making objects function-like and reusable through `__call__()`.
* **Custom Exceptions**: Creating and handling specific error types with custom exceptions.
* **Iterable Objects**: Making custom classes iterable by implementing the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.

## **Why This Project?**

This project demonstrates essential OOP concepts in Python, offering practical, real-world applications that will make you proficient in managing object-oriented designs. From understanding method resolution in inheritance to utilizing decorators and custom exceptions, this project is a hands-on guide to mastering OOP.
