# Constructors and Destructors in Python

## ðŸ”§ What is a Constructor?

* A **constructor** in Python is a special method named `__init__()`.
* It is **automatically called** when a new object of a class is created.
* Constructors are typically used to **initialize object attributes** or perform setup tasks when an instance is created.

## ðŸ”¥ What is a Destructor?

* A **destructor** is a special method named `__del__()`.
* It is **automatically called** when an object is destroyed, such as when it goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
* Destructors are commonly used to **clean up resources**, like closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from services.

Constructors and destructors are essential parts of object lifecycle management in Python. They help ensure that objects are properly initialized when created and that any necessary cleanup is done when they are no longer needed.
