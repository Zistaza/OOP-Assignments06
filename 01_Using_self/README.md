#Understanding Classes and Objects in Python
In Python, classes and objects are fundamental to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Understanding the distinction between them is crucial for working effectively with OOP principles. Here's a simple analogy to explain the difference:
Class vs Object: The Blueprint and the Real Thing
•	Class: Think of a class as a blueprint or template for creating something. It's like a design plan that defines the structure, attributes, and behaviors (methods) of something you want to build. For example, a house blueprint defines how many rooms, windows, and doors the house will have, but it is not a house itself.
•	Object: An object is an instance of a class, created from that blueprint. In our analogy, it's like an actual house built using the blueprint. The house has all the features defined in the blueprint, but it is a real entity you can touch, live in, and modify. Similarly, in programming, an object is created from the class and contains the actual data for the attributes defined in the class.

#Key Differences:

#Class	Object
A class is a blueprint or template.	An object is an instance of a class.
A class defines the structure and behavior (attributes and methods) of the objects.	An object is a real-world entity created using the class blueprint.
A class does not hold data by itself. It provides a way to create data.	An object holds actual data for the attributes defined in the class.
Example: class Student: defines what attributes and methods a student should have.	Example: student1 = Student("Alice", 88) creates a specific student object.
You define a class once and can create multiple objects from it.	You create an object by calling the class and passing data to it.
Classes can have class attributes (shared by all objects).	Objects have instance attributes (unique data for each object).

#Summary of the Difference:
•	A class is the blueprint or design.
•	An object is the real instance created from that blueprint.
