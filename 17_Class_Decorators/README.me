# Class Decorators in Python

---

## ðŸ“˜ Concept Overview

Class decorators are used to modify or enhance a class when it is defined. They allow you to add functionality to classes without altering their original code. This is achieved by using the `@decorator_name` syntax above the class definition.

## âœ… Explanation

In this example, we define a class decorator named `add_greeting` that adds a new method `greet()` to the `Person` class.

### Key Details:

1. **Class Decorator Definition**:

   * The `add_greeting` decorator function takes a class `cls` as input.
   * It adds a new method `greet(self)` to the class, which returns the string `"Hello from Decorator!"`.
   * After modifying the class, the decorator returns the modified class.

2. **Applying the Decorator**:

   * The `@add_greeting` decorator is applied directly above the `Person` class definition.
   * This automatically adds the `greet()` method to the `Person` class.

3. **Accessing the Added Method**:

   * Once the `Person` class is decorated, all instances of the `Person` class have access to the `greet()` method.
   * Calling `greet()` will return `"Hello from Decorator!"`.

By using class decorators, we can enhance or modify the behavior of classes in a flexible and reusable way.
