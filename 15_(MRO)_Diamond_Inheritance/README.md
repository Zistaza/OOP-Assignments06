# Method Resolution Order (MRO) and Diamond Inheritance in Python

---
### Method Resolution Order (MRO)

* **MRO** determines the order in which methods are searched in a class hierarchy, particularly in multiple inheritance scenarios. It ensures that the correct method is called when multiple classes inherit from the same base class.

### Diamond Inheritance

* **Diamond Inheritance** occurs when a class inherits from two classes, both of which inherit from a common base class, forming a diamond-shaped structure. MRO resolves potential method conflicts in this structure by providing a well-defined method lookup order.

## ‚úÖ Assignment Explanation

In this assignment, we created four classes:

* **Class A**: Defines the method `show()`.
* **Class B** and **Class C**: Inherit from `A` and override the `show()` method.
* **Class D**: Inherits from both `B` and `C`.

### MRO in Action:

* When an object of `D` calls the `show()` method, Python uses the **Method Resolution Order** (MRO) to determine which method to invoke.
* In our example, since `D` inherits from `B` first, the `show()` method from class `B` will be called.

## üîç Key Points

* **The `__mro__` attribute**:
  The `__mro__` attribute of a class provides the MRO, showing the order in which Python looks for methods in the class hierarchy.

* **Predictable Order**:
  MRO ensures that methods are called in a predictable order, avoiding conflicts that arise in cases of diamond inheritance.

* **MRO in Multiple Inheritance**:
  In cases of multiple inheritance, MRO helps avoid ambiguity, ensuring that the correct method is called from the appropriate class.

## üìå Conclusion

* **MRO** is a vital mechanism in multiple inheritance, ensuring that method resolution is unambiguous and predictable.
* **Diamond inheritance** is resolved by MRO, ensuring that methods are executed from the correct class according to the class hierarchy.

By understanding MRO, we can confidently work with complex inheritance structures and avoid method conflicts in multiple inheritance scenarios.
