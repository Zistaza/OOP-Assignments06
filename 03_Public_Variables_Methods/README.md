# Public Variables and Methods in Python

## 📘 Objective

Understand how to define and access **public variables** and **public methods** from outside a class in Python.

---

## ✅ Explanation

In Python, **public members** (attributes and methods) are accessible from outside the class using an **object** (also known as an instance).

> 🔹 By default, all class variables and methods are public unless explicitly made private or protected.

---

## 🛠️ Key Concepts

### 🔹 Public Variable

A variable defined inside a class that can be **accessed or modified directly** using an object.

### 🔹 Public Method

A function defined inside a class that can be **called using the object**.

### 🔹 Object (Instance)

A specific, real-world example created from a class. Each object can have **unique values** for its variables.

## 📌 Summary

| **Term**        | **Description**                                                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public Variable | Accessible and modifiable from outside the class.                                       |
| Public Method   | Callable from outside the class using the object.                                       |
| Object          | An entity created from the class, holding its own data but sharing the class structure. |

> ✅ You can create **multiple objects** from the same class. Each object has its own data, but they share the same structure (variables and methods).
